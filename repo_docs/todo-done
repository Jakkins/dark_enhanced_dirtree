# TODO

- [ ] python release
- [ ] automatic build and release
- [ ] look at how to add plugin / extensions
  - [ ] markdown_extensions
- [ ] show/hide dirtree

## Possible ideas / changes

- other methods to keep the nav open/close state without refresh the page, or with page refresh
  - example: ad each refresh a script runs to open the nav from the page using actual path (I already have this script). At the moment the refresh is bypassed.
- change path without refresh the page
- can I use <object data="framed.html" type="text/html"><p>This is the fallback code!</p></object> tag in some way?
- iframe can be refreshed without redirecting parent page

# DONE

- [x] keep track of last nav item clicked
- [x] support to this url format: [internal page](internal/page/)
